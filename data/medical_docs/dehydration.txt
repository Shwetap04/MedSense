Title: Dehydration – Causes, Symptoms, Self-Care, and Prevention

Overview:
Dehydration occurs when the body loses more fluids than it takes in. It can happen due to heat exposure, exercise, illness, or inadequate water intake. Mild dehydration is common and easily reversible, while severe dehydration is a medical emergency.

Common Causes:
- Not drinking enough water
- Excessive sweating due to heat or exercise
- Vomiting or diarrhea
- Fever
- Diabetes with excess urination
- Caffeine and alcohol consumption
- Certain medications (diuretics)

Symptoms:
- Thirst and dry mouth
- Headache and dizziness
- Fatigue or weakness
- Dark yellow urine
- Muscle cramps
- Dry skin
- Rapid heartbeat (in severe cases)

Self-Care:
- Drink water slowly and steadily.
- Use ORS (Oral Rehydration Salts) if dehydrated from vomiting/diarrhea.
- Avoid caffeine and alcohol until recovery.
- Rest in a cool environment.

Prevention:
- Drink water regularly throughout the day.
- Increase intake during exercise or heat exposure.
- Eat hydrating foods (fruits, cucumbers, soups).
- Monitor urine color as a hydration indicator.

Red Flags (seek medical help):
- Confusion or fainting
- No urination for 8+ hours
